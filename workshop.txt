title=[B42.13] Hammertime - Another PZ Building mod
description=[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WorkingClassKid/steam_images/main/Hammertime_Banner.png[/img]
description=[h2]A building mod for those who actually want to… build.[/h2]
description=Hammertime is a mod designed to enrich the building experience in Project Zomboid. Originally created for my multiplayer server, it adds a wide variety of new craftable items and structures, allowing players to progress in construction without having to tear apart every house in the county.
description=
description=The goal is simple: fill the lack of diversity in the vanilla content and finally offer real options to build, furnish, and customize your base.
description=
description=[h2]Vanilla‑friendly - No external dependencies[/h2]
description=
description=No external dependencies, no weird mechanics — Hammertime stays deliberately vanilla‑friendly to ensure maximum compatibility and long‑term updates.
description=
description=Hammertime is split into several sub‑mods that you can enable as you wish, depending on what you want to add to your game.
description=
description=[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
description=
description=Hammertime is [b]not compatible with other construction mods[/b], since at some point they modify the same functions and files, which causes conflicts.
description=
description=However, Hammertime should be compatible with all other mods that are not related to construction.
description=
description=Tested on B42.13.2 SP/MP

description=[h2]Known issues[/h2]
description=- The character sits next to certain chairs after building them.
description=Quick fix: You can pick up the chair and place it back down, and it will work as intended. (I’m still trying to figure out why)
