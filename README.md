# Hammertime
## A building mod for those who actually want to… build

__You can subscribe to this mod on Steam at the following address:__

Hammertime is a mod designed to enrich the building experience in Project Zomboid. Originally created for my multiplayer server, it adds a wide variety of new craftable items and structures, allowing players to progress in construction without having to tear apart every house in the county.

The goal is simple: fill the lack of diversity in the vanilla content and finally offer real options to build, furnish, and customize your base.

## Vanilla‑friendly - No external dependencies

No external dependencies, no weird mechanics — Hammertime stays deliberately vanilla‑friendly to ensure maximum compatibility and long‑term updates.

Hammertime is split into several sub‑mods that you can enable as you wish, depending on what you want to add to your game.

## Compatibility

Hammertime is __not compatible with other construction mods__, since at some point they modify the same functions and files, which causes conflicts.

However, Hammertime should be compatible with all other mods that are not related to construction.

Tested on B42.13.2 SP/MP

## Known issues
- The character sits next to certain chairs after building them.
Quick fix: You can pick up the chair and place it back down, and it will work as intended. (I’m still trying to figure out why)
