Hammertime – A building mod for those who actually want to… build.

Hammertime is a mod designed to enrich the building experience in Project Zomboid. Originally created for my multiplayer server, it adds a wide variety of new craftable items and structures, allowing players to progress in construction without having to tear apart every house in the county.

The goal is simple: fill the lack of diversity in the vanilla content and finally offer real options to build, furnish, and customize your base.

No external dependencies, no weird mechanics — Hammertime stays deliberately vanilla‑friendly to ensure maximum compatibility and long‑term updates.

Hammertime is split into several sub‑mods that you can enable as you wish, depending on what you want to add to your game.
